# Tools used

For the creation and maintenance of the DTA infrastructure we are using the following tool

- go / golang
    Just a cool language, that we are happy to able to use.
- [grpc.io](http://grpc.ip)
```
brew install protobuf
brew install protoc-gen-go
rehash
```

- [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway)
    The grpc-gateway is a plugin of the Google protocol buffers compiler protoc. It reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which 'translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according to the google.api.http annotations in your service definitions.

    We are using this to create bi-protocol servers, that support both GRPC and REST (optional) communication. And to create the swagger specification out of the proto specification.

```
go install \                                                         
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/protoc-gen-swagger \
    github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go

go get github.com/mwitkow/go-proto-validators/protoc-gen-govalidators
rehash
```

- [github.com/go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger)
    go-swagger brings to the go community a complete suite of fully-featured, high-performance, API components to work with a Swagger API: server, client and data model.

    We are using this to create REST clients, as well to pilot REST only servers

    Example usage (from makefile):

    ```Makefile
    gen/rest_client/dtaservice_proto_client.go: swagger/dtaservice.swagger.json
    swagger generate client -c gen/rest_client -s gen/rest_api -m gen/rest_models -f swagger/dtaservice.swagger.json

    gen/rest_api/configure_dtaservice_proto.go: swagger/dtaservice.swagger.json
    swagger generate server -c gen/rest_client -s gen/rest_api -m gen/rest_models -f swagger/dtaservice.swagger.json
    ```

    code for clients is generated into `gen/rest_client` while code for servers is generated into `gen/rest_api`. The models reside in ´gen/rest_models`

    As exachange format we are using a json-formatted swagger file generated by the grpc-gateway.

```
brew tap go-swagger/go-swagger
brew install go-swagger
rehash
```
